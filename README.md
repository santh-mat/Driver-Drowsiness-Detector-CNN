# Driver-Drowsiness-Detector-CNN
Basic DL project for Driver Drowsiness Detection using CNN and OpenCV

The Python-coded DL project was designed for the detection of driver drowsiness using CNNs and Computer Vision. Various models like a custom CNN, a ResNet50, and so on were used in Jupyter Notebook for the model construction, training and performance evaluation. Upon model selection, the real-time project demonstration was done in Pycharm with webcam feed.
